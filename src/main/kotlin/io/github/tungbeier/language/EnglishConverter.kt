/** **English numbering rules**
 * - Digits from zero to nine are specific words, as well as numbers from ten to twelve,
 * namely zero [0], one [1], two [2], three [3], four [4], five [5], six [6], seven [7],
 * eight [8], nine [9], ten [10], eleven [11], and twelve [12].
 * - From thirteen to nineteen, the numbers are formed from the digits three to nine,
 * adding the -teen suffix at the end: thirteen [13], fourteen [14], fifteen [15],
 * sixteen [16], seventeen [17], eighteen [18], and nineteen [19].
 * - The tens are formed by adding the -(t)y suffix at the end of the multiplier digit root,
 * with the exception of ten: ten [10], twenty [20], thirty [30], forty [40] (and not forty),
 * fifty [50], sixty [60], seventy [70], eighty [80], and ninety [90].
 * - From twenty-one to ninety-nine, the tens and units are joined with a hyphen.
 * - All the three-digit numbers are constructed by stating the hundreds,
 * then adding the and word, then the tens and the digits
 * (e.g.: two hundred and sixty-five [265]). Using the coordination and is a matter of choice,
 * as whereas some writers prefer using it, The Chicago Manual of Styleâ€™s preference is to omit it.
 * - Hundred (100), thousand (1,000) and million (1,000,000) are always singular
 * (e.g.: six hundred and thirty-five [635]).
 * - When directly added to hundred and thousand, the and word is added before tens
 * and units (e.g.: seven hundred and three [703], or five thousand and two [5,002]).
